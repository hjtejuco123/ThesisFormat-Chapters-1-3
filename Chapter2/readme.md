## III. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Introduction of Chapter 2

**What to include:**
- Overview of the chapter
- Importance of reviewing related works
- Connection to the present study

**Example:**

> This chapter presents the review of related literature and studies relevant to the present research. It includes both foreign and local literature and studies that provide theoretical and empirical support to the variables investigated. The synthesis highlights gaps in previous research which justify the conduct of the present study.

### Step 2: Review of Related Literature

> **Literature** refers to theories, concepts, laws, models, and expert opinions.

#### A. Foreign Literature

**What to look for:**
- Definitions of key concepts
- Theories related to variables
- Models and frameworks
- International standards

**How to write:**
- One concept per paragraph
- Start with author and year
- Paraphrase ideas
- Relate to your study

**Example:**

> According to Porter (2018), organizational performance is influenced by leadership style, communication, and employee motivation. He emphasized that transformational leadership improves employee engagement, resulting in higher productivity. This concept supports the present study, which examines leadership style as a factor affecting employee performance.

---

#### B. Local Literature

**What to look for:**
- Philippine authors
- Local laws and policies (CHED, DepEd, DOH, etc.)
- Local books and institutional publications

**Example:**

> Aquino (2019) emphasized that effective classroom management significantly affects student learning outcomes. In the Philippine context, structured classroom routines were found to enhance discipline and engagement. This literature supports the present study focusing on classroom management strategies in public schools.

---

### Step 3: Review of Related Studies

> **Studies** are actual research works such as theses, dissertations, and journal articles.

#### A. Foreign Studies

**What to include:**
- Author(s) and year
- Research design
- Respondents
- Major findings
- Relevance to your study

**Example:**

> Smith and Johnson (2020) conducted a quantitative study on the effects of online learning on student motivation among 300 college students in the United States. Findings revealed that interactive platforms significantly increased motivation. This study is related to the present research as it investigates online learning and student engagement.

---

#### B. Local Studies

**Example:**

> Dela Cruz (2021) conducted a descriptive study on study habits of senior high school students in Manila. Results indicated that time management significantly influenced academic performance. This local study supports the present research examining factors affecting academic achievement.

---

### Step 4: Synthesis of Literature and Studies

**Purpose:**
- Integrate findings
- Compare and contrast studies
- Show trends and patterns
- Relate all to your variables

**Example:**

> Both foreign and local studies indicate that motivation and learning environment significantly affect academic performance. Foreign studies emphasize technology integration, while local studies focus on teaching strategies and classroom conditions. These insights highlight the importance of contextual factors, which the present study seeks to further examine.

---

### Step 5: Research Gap

**Common types of gaps:**
- Lack of local studies
- Different population or setting
- Outdated literature
- Unexplored variables
- Different methodology

**Example:**

> Despite extensive research on student motivation, limited local studies have focused on senior high school students in rural areas using blended learning. Thus, this study aims to address this gap by examining the relationship between blended learning and academic performance in rural senior high schools.

## IV. Best Practices

- Use paraphrasing; avoid direct copying
- Follow required citation style (APA, etc.)
- Use past tense for studies
- Link each paragraph to your study
- Balance foreign and local sources
- Use recent references (last 5–10 years)

---

## V. Best Approaches

### 1. Thematic Approach (Recommended)
- Organize literature by themes or variables

### 2. Chronological Approach
- Arrange from oldest to newest studies

### 3. Conceptual Approach
- Align discussion with conceptual framework
